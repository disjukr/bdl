# BDL Project Structure

A single BDL project consists of a configuration file that points to BDL packages, a package directory containing multiple modules, and individual module files within it.

Module files have the `.bdl` extension and are written in the BDL language.

You can check the BDL language in the [syntax](./syntax.md) documentation.
