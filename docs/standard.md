# Standard

BDL aims to support various serialization formats and RPC protocols based on a common grammar.
However, in reality, there are too many formats and protocols with differing supported features
and design philosophies, making it difficult to cover all of them perfectly with a single standard.

Therefore, BDL introduces the `standard` attribute,
which specifies the conventions to be applied on a per-file basis.
This allows each file to clearly define
"which primitive types are provided, and which serialization formats and RPC protocols are to be used."

Details on the syntax of BDL files are covered in the [BDL Syntax](./syntax.md) document.\
The actual contents of BDL files are covered in the [Intermediate Representation (IR)](./ir.md) document.

# The `conventional` standard

This document aims to explain the BDL standard called `conventional`.
The official tooling provided by BDL will understand and support the conventional standard well.
While BDL generally encourages defining and using your own standard tailored to your specific situation,
for those who are unsure about what to define and how to use it,
the `conventional` standard will serve as a good starting point.

First, all BDL files begin by specifying which standard is designated for that file.

```bdl
# standard - conventional
```

## Naming convention

Each type definition within a module,
regardless of its form (`custom`, `enum`, `oneof`, `proc`, `struct`, or `union`),
must have a unique name within that module.

And because there are environments like Swift or OpenAPI where namespaces are not properly supported,
type definitions should also have unique names within the global module tree whenever possible.

Package names and each segment of a module path should follow _snake_case_.\
Attribute names should follow _snake_case_.\
Primitive type names should follow _flatcase_.\
Type definition names should follow _PascalCase_.\
Field names should follow _camelCase_.

```bdl
# standard - conventional

import pkg_name.module_path { ExternalType }

@ my_attribute
struct MyStruct {
  myField: string,
}
```

Since code generation may adapt naming to conventions of each target language,
acronyms in _camelCase_ or _PascalCase_ should be treated as if they were regular words.

e.g.

- Use `HttpRequest` instead of `HTTPRequest`
- Use `userId` instead of `userID`

## Primitive Types

> [!WARNING]
> The `int64` and `integer` types should be handled with care.
>
> In some environments where 64-bit integers are not fully supported,
> [only up to 53 bits may be safely represented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).\
> For example, JavaScriptâ€™s `JSON.parse` function interprets all numeric input as 64-bit floating-point numbers,
> which can lead to precision loss for 64-bit integers.
>
> Although the official implementation of BDL handles JSON parsing directly to preserve data as much as possible,
> if the JSON is already parsed by the framework before BDL processes it, the information may already be lost.
>
> In Swift as well, integers that exceed the 64-bit range may be interpreted as 64-bit floating-point numbers, leading to similar issues.

- `boolean`: Represents `true` or `false`
- `int32`: A 32-bit integer ranging from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`
- `int64`: A 64-bit integer ranging from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`
- `integer`: An arbitrary integer including negative numbers
- `float64`: [A 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
- `string`: A unicode string
- `bytes`: A byte array
- `object`: A dictionary with string keys and values of any type
- `void`: Represents the absence of a value
  - It can only be specified as the input or output type in a [Proc declaration](./syntax.md#Proc)

## JSON Ser/Des

The JSON serialization format is useful in a variety of situations.

It is commonly used when writing runtime objects to files and is also a supported type in major relational databases.\
In particular, it is used as the data format exchanged between server and client in OpenAPI and JSON RPC.

Therefore, the BDL conventional standard places a strong emphasis on JSON serialization and deserialization.

### JSON Ser/Des - Primitive types

- The `boolean`, numeric (`int32`, `int64`, `integer`, `float64`), and `string` types are serialized to JSON in an obvious manner.
  - For the `float64` type, when attempting to serialize values like `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity`, the behavior is implementation defined.\
    The implementation must not serialize these values in a way that is incompatible with the JSON specification.
    It must choose whether to serialize them as `null` or to raise an error, and document this choice in its specification.
  - When deserializing `null` into a `float64`, the behavior is implementation defined.\
    The implementation must choose whether to deserialize it as `0` or as `NaN`, and document this choice in its specification.
- The `bytes` type is serialized as a base64-encoded string.
- The `object` type is serialized as a JSON object.
  The keys are straightforward, but the serialization behavior for the values is unspecified and depends on the implementation.
